# Vacancy parser<br />
I wrote this program to monitor vacancies from different sites at the click of one button. The program takes information from the following sites: djinni.co, dou.ua, work.ua<br />
At the moment, it turned out to implement the receipt of all vacancies upon request from the site djinni.co and work.ua. From the site dou.ua I managed to get only the last 20 vacancies.
